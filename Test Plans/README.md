# Test Plans

This folder contains formal QA test plans for various projects and features. All plans are presented in Excel format, except for the template(there is also a Markdown file of it).

## Purpose
Each test plan defines the overall testing approach for a specific feature, product, or release. It provides the foundation for structured testing and helps ensure clarity across teams.

## What's Included
- Testing objectives and scope
- Entry and exit criteria
- Test coverage boundaries (what will and wonâ€™t be tested)
- Strategy for manual and/or automated testing
- Resources, schedule, risks, and assumptions
- Risks and potential problems

## Usage
These documents guide QA efforts, align stakeholders, and serve as reference points throughout the test lifecycle.
